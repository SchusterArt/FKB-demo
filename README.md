# FKB-demo 
This is a small demo representing the flying arcade model (KinematicBody).
Demo does not represent the final quality of the Godot engine  (MIT licensed game engine http://godotengine.org)
because it was created in Godot Alpha1 version 3.1 and can contain bugs and issues. 

Controls is a classical wasd + E - boost speed (pressed), LShift - cruising speed, Q - stand by engines mode,LMB or space  - fire  ,R - look back , ESC - return to welcome screen, also Gamepad controls are added.

Demo is MIT licensed ,all models,textures,scripts created by me for the community (except two screen space shaders from official Godot 3.0 demos (in demo unused).

Novices to  Godot engine who want something 3d to fly and do not know where to start like me when I started with the Godot engine, 
so this demo is just for them.
Note: all scenes and scripts for the demo are in the "tests" folder just the main scene is in the "scenes" folder, it is not usual
but I did not want to move it.
